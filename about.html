        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            Our mission is to empower developers to express their creativity, identity, and passion for coding through high-quality, stylish apparel.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that being a developer is more than just writing  code, it's a lifestyle, a community and a mindset. That's why we design shirts that celebrate programming culture, from coding references to designs that speak to innovation and problem-solving. Every shirt is made with comfort and durability in mind, so you can feel confident whether you're  in office or just relaxing after a long day of coding. Our goal is to unite developers everywhere with apparel that sparks conversation, build connections, and showcases the pride of being part of the tech world.
